# We use Chula's 5000 most frequent words to calculate likelihood of sentence
# many flaws in this because the word bank includes not real words
# like characters in the alphabet, so the scoring is skewed 
# also the most frequent word does not mean that it is correct in that context

# Problem: sometimes the of the same sentence is calculated twice, this happens because 
# we are using 2 word banks

*There are 2 files, one for running the server and one for run in the python idle.
